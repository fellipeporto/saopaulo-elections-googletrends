# saopaulo-elections-googletrends
Project about the impact of the political advertising in the Google Trends during the municipal elections in São Paulo - Brazil 

For this project I use the package gtrendsR, that is a way to get the number of searchs of a topic in the site of Google. For more information: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtrendsR/gtrendsR.pdf

The object of analysis was the candidates for mayor of the biggest South America city: São Paulo.
